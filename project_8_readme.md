# Project 8 - Pentesting Live Targets

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

> Objective: Identify vulnerabilities in three different versions of the Globitek website: blue, green, and red.

The six possible exploits are:
* Username Enumeration
* Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
* SQL Injection (SQLi)
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
* Session Hijacking/Fixation

Each version of the site has been given two of the six vulnerabilities. (In other words, all six of the exploits should be assignable to one of the sites.)

## Blue

Vulnerability #1: SQLI Injection

![Week9_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32075350/56174054-a816c400-5fbe-11e9-8820-0a9d347a5b29.gif)

It can be seen in the gif above, when the apostrophe (') is written in the end of the URL for the green and redwe are simply redirected to the same page. In the blue; however, it results in a database query failiure which shows that the blue site had SQL Injection vulnerability.
